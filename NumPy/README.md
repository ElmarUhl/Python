NumPy is a fundamental library for scientific computing in Python. It offers powerful tools for working with multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a vast collection of mathematical functions for operating on these arrays.

One of the key advantages of NumPy is its efficient handling of arrays. Unlike Python lists, enabling much faster processing, especially for vectorized operations. This makes NumPy exceptionally well-suited for data analysis, machine learning, and other scientific computing tasks in Python.

Here's a concise overview of what NumPy brings to the table:

- Multi-dimensional arrays: NumPy empowers you to create and work with arrays of various dimensions, going beyond the limitations of Python lists.
- Mathematical functions: It provides a rich set of mathematical functions that can be applied efficiently to entire arrays at once, rather than iterating through elements individually.
- Performance: Due to its optimized implementation in C, NumPy offers significant performance gains over Python lists for numerical computations.
- Integration with other libraries: NumPy serves as the foundation for many other scientific Python libraries, such as SciPy, Matplotlib, and pandas, fostering a powerful ecosystem for scientific computing.

In summary, NumPy is an essential library for anyone working with numerical data in Python. Its capabilities in array manipulation, mathematical operations, and performance optimization make it a cornerstone of scientific computing in the Python programming language.

# Install Numpy Package
To install Numpy, you must type in prompt the command

```pip install numpy```

Usually Numpy already installed in most of Linux Python Distribuitions and this procedure isn't necessary.
If you not sure Numpy is installed in your system. You can run the command

```pip list```

and locate if Numpy is listed.
